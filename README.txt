Bootstrap Knowledge Check Assignment

 I created a web page using Bootstrap to style it. I made sure to include a navigation bar, a form, a table, and images that all have Bootstrap applied. I also used a git repository to save the page on my computer and created a web-based repository on git hub to access the page as well. 

The navigation bar was set up with a fluid container and styled with Bootstrap. It includes links to Home, About, and Contact. These links are set up to collapse on smaller screens into a hamburger menu. Also used a bootstrap-styled "rounded" image for the homepage link. 

The form is styled using Bootstrap, and I made sure that the first and last name input sits side by side. But for smaller screens, the inputs adjust to have the last name input sit under the first name. I did this by making those 2 inputs on their own "row" within the grid container and setting them both "col-12 col-md-6" to switch from taking up the whole width to half the width based on the screen size. At the bottom of the form, I included buttons that are styled with Bootstrap. For the second button, I used the "d-none" and "d-md-block" classes to hide the button when the screen gets smaller. 

The table is set in a div element with the class "table-responsive", and was also made responsive by adding classes to make each row stripped and hoverable. User data was hard-coded into the table and I included examples with Bootstrap styles on the user's status whether active, pending, or inactive. 

In included 2 images after the table and inside a grid container. One set to the "img-fluid" class to stretch across the page. the second image is set to "rounded-circle".
